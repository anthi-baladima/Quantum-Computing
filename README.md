# Quantum-Computing
Coding popular quantum algorithms. The programs were then modified to solve 3-SAT and graph coloring problem.

This depository contains the work i have done for my thesis. It includes code for Quantum Phase Estimation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm, using Qiskit. Grover's algorithm uses a dynamically created oracle for up to 5 qubits. Shor's algorithm program factors 21 using a hard-coded U-gate. An alternative is also included that only uses one target qubit and dynamically changes the U gate to factor different numbers. 

Additionally, there is a program that uses QPE and Grover's Algorithm based on the Quantum Counting Algorithm and then solves a 3-SAT problem. Using this code, a Graph Coloring Problem is solved by translating the graph restrictions to a 3-CNF expression.
